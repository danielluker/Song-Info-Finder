# Song-Info-Finder
A small application which will take a list of song titles of the form "song title - artist", and will retrieve the information about the song (correct name, artist name, album, year, composer, and perhaps even image), and update the song info. This will make it easy to upload music to a mobile device and have the info correct, or just to keep music libraries updated.
